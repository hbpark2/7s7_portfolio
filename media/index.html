                                        On 27th July 1890 a gaunt figure
                                        stumbled down a drowsy high street at
                                        twilight in the small French country town
                                        of Auvers.

                                        The man was carrying nothing; his hands clasped to a fresh bullet wound leaking blood from his belly.
                                        This was Vincent van Gogh, then a little known artist; now the most famous artist in the world.
                                        His tragic death has long been known, what has remained a mystery is how and why he came to be shot.
                                        Loving Vincent tells that story.

                                        Vincent van Gogh is the world’s most famous painter. His Starry Night, Café Terrace at Night, Sunflowers, Wheatfield with Crows and indeed his own face in his many self-portraits are among the most recognised images in our world.

                                        Vincent is not only famous for his paintings, but also for his tortured life, notably for cutting off his ear and shooting himself while painting at his easel; painting to the bitter end of his unhappy misunderstood life. He is the world’s totemic ‘tortured artist’. Loving Vincent explores Vincent’s life and work by bringing to life some of Vincent van Gogh’s most inspirational paintings to tell his story.</span>

                                        We painted over 65,000 frames on over 1,000 canvases. We shot the film with actors, and literally painted over it frame by frame. This is a very laborious and time-consuming process. It has taken us 4 years to develop the technique, and it took us over 2 years with a team of over 100 painters working at studios in the Polish cities of Gdansk and Wroclaw, and a studio in Athens to complete the film.
